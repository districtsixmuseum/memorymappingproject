            "Summary": "In 1921 the Cape Hospital Board opened the Peninsula Maternity Home as a segregated facility. Midwives underwent training there and many would deliver babies at family homes in District Six. In 1961 the hospital started to provide services to only women of colour. Midwives such as Nurse Kleinschmidt were popular figures in the District. The hospital closed in 1991 and its staff moved to the Mowbray Maternity Hospital. In 2018 a new health facility, the District Six Community Day Centre, was opened on the site.",
